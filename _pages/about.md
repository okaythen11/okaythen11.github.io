Imagine Flash
======
In may researchers at meta published imagine flash a new accleleration method for diffusion models.
Which aims to keep similar quality of the original but significalnty reduces the cost of inference.


Introduction
======


Diffusion models
------
Diffusion models are powerful generative models their impresive performace outshines other model architectures in areas such as image generation.
While they are quite great at what they do there are some drawbacks namely in the effieceny department compared to other model-typer such as 
GANs or VAEs. Diffusion models take longer to train often requiering more data, they have generally a higher demand for Hardware resources such as VRAM and 
require higher energy usage to produce resulsts.


Existing Methods
------
Among existing methods to speed up diffusion model inference there are Solvers and curvature rectification,Reduction of model size and the reduction of sampling steps then there is also 
step distillation
